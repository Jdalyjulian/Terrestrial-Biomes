      <h3 id="section1">ðŸŒ´ Tropical Rain Forest</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Precipitation</strong>: 100" per year in the form of rain.
        <br />
        <strong>Temperature</strong>: Hot and moist; temperature ranges between
        80Â°F to 100Â°F year round.
        <br />
        <strong>Seasons</strong>: There are no seasons.
        <br />
        <strong>Topography</strong>: River basins, tropical volcanic islands,
        windward side of mountains
        <br />
        <strong>Soil</strong>: Less than 1cm of topsoil. Very poor soil due to
        the fact that there are so many organisms competing for nutrients.
        <br />
        <strong>Producers</strong>: Mirants Tigrina, Epiphyte (orchid), Bengal
        Bamboo
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Large wide leaves to gather sunlight in
        the lower canopies. Plants grow on other plants and don't have roots in
        the ground to get higher in the canopy for sun. Shallow and thick roots
        to soak up water quickly.
        <br />
        <strong>Consumers</strong>: Wagler's Pit Viper, Silvery Gibbon, Slender
        Loris
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Camoflauge. Animals live in trees. Poison
        and venom.

      <h3 id="section2">ðŸŒ³ Temperate (Deciduous) Forest</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Precipitation</strong>: 30-100" per year in the form of rain,
        snow, hail, fog, etc.
        <br />
        <strong>Temperature</strong>: Average summer high ranges from 70Â°F to
        85Â°F and the average winter high ranges from 20Â°F to 40Â°F.
        <br />
        <strong>Seasons</strong>: All 4 seasons
        <br />
        <strong>Topography</strong>: Low mountains, hills, and plains
        <br />
        <strong>Soil</strong>: Deep soil layers. Rich in nutrients.
        <br />
        <strong>Producers</strong>: Lady Fern, Guelder Rose, Hickory Tree, Maple
        Tree, White Birch Tree
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: More ground dwelling plants since sunlight
        reaches the floor. Trees have thick, strong bark that protects them from
        harsh winter winds and snows. Trees go dormant in the winter and lose
        their leaves to conserve energy.
        <br />
        <strong>Consumers</strong>: Fox, Squirrel, Least Weasel, Black Bear,
        Wood Warbler
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Thick winter coat. Hibernation. Migration.
        Claws for climbing.

      <h3 id="section3">ðŸŒµ Desert</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Precipitation</strong>: Less than 10" per year in the form of
        rain.
        <br />
        <strong>Temperature</strong>: Average summer high ranges from 90Â°F to
        120Â°F. Hot days and cold nights.
        <br />
        <strong>Seasons</strong>:2 seasons, a dry hot summer and a winter
        season.
        <br />
        <strong>Topography</strong>: From vast cobble flats to mobile dune seas,
        bone dry arroyos to lofty mountains
        <br />
        <strong>Soil</strong>: Little to no topsoil (soil vegetation can grow
        best in) due to high winds. Soil depth varies - can be deep, shallow,
        salty, or have cement like crusts.
        <br />
        <strong>Producers</strong>: Saguaro Cactus, Aloe Vera, Barrel Cactus,
        Joshua Tree
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Many plants have spines (needle like
        thorns). Succulents have a thick waxy cuticle to hold water. Shallow and
        broad roots to absorb water rapidly when rain finally falls. Other
        plants have long roots to find water deep down in the water table.
        <br />
        <strong>Consumers</strong>: Cactus Mouse, Kit Fox, Desert Tortoise, Jack
        Rabbit, Fennec Fox
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Many animals only need water from food
        they eat. Many animals are nocturnal. Animals also burrow to stay cool
        underground. Some animals have large ears to keep cool.

      <h3 id="section4">ðŸ—» Tundra</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Precipitation</strong>: 6-10" per year in the form of rain and
        snow.
        <br />
        <strong>Temperature</strong>: Average summer high ranges from 37Â°F to
        54Â°F and the average winter high ranges from -30Â°F to 0Â°F.
        <br />
        <strong>Seasons</strong>: Long cold winters and a 60 day growing season
        in the summer.
        <br />
        <strong>Topography</strong>: The land is relatively flat with small
        hills, valleys and slopes.
        <br />
        <strong>Soil</strong>: Made of permafrost (premanently frozen). The soil
        is poor due to little decomposition because of the constant freezing
        temperatures.
        <br />
        <strong>Producers</strong>: Reindeer Lichen, Arctic Willow, White Arctic
        Bell Heather, Cottongrass
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Grow close to the ground. Thin leaves to
        prevent transpiration. Shallow roots, Fast growing seasons.
        <br />
        <strong>Consumers</strong>: Musk Ox, Caribou, Lemming, Snowy Owl, Arctic
        Fox, Grizzly Bear
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Small ears to prevent frostbite. Thick fur
        or feathers. Seasonal fur/feathers to camouflage. Larger animals have
        stocky bodies with short legs to prevent heat loss.

      <h3 id="section5">ðŸŒ² Taiga (Boreal Forest)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Precipitation</strong>: 12-33" per year in the form of rain and
        snow.
        <br />
        <strong>Temperature</strong>: Average summer high ranges from 65Â°F to
        75Â°F and the average winter high ranges from 0Â°F to 20Â°F.
        <br />
        <strong>Seasons</strong>: Two major seasons, a long winter and short
        summer.
        <br />
        <strong>Topography</strong>: Mountains, flatlands, bogs, valleys, and
        depressions
        <br />
        <strong>Soil</strong>: Poor in nutrients and very acidic. Leaves and
        debris stay frozen to there are few nutrients in the soil because there
        is no decomposition occurring.
        <br />
        <strong>Producers</strong>: Red Spruce, Douglas Fir, Jack Pine,
        Bearberry
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Shallow and wide spreading roots. Needles
        on trees are thin and waxy to conserve water. Trees are triangular in
        shape to allow snow to fall off. Plants are evergreens which means they
        do photosynthesis all year and do not regrow new leaves in the spring.
        <br />
        <strong>Consumers</strong>: Moose, Great Grey Owl, Snowshoe Hare,
        Northern Leopard Frog, Chipmunk, White-Throated Sparrow
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Some animals change fur color in winter
        and summer. Hibernation. Thick fur/feathered coats. Migrate to warmer
        climates.

      <h3 id="section6">ðŸŒ¿ Temperate Grassland (Prairie)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Precipitation</strong>: 10-30" per year in the form of rain,
        sleet, and snow.
        <br />
        <strong>Temperature</strong>: The average temperatures in summer are
        around 70Â°F and the average winter is around 20Â°F.
        <br />
        <strong>Seasons</strong>: Summers are warm and humid. Winters are cold.
        <br />
        <strong>Topography</strong>: Mainly flat and rolling lands.
        <br />
        <strong>Soil</strong>: Deep and dark soils with fertile upper layers. It
        is nutrient-rich from the growth and decay of grasses. This soil is
        known as the "bread basket" of the United States because most of the
        nation's wheat is grown there.
        <br />
        <strong>Producers</strong>: Buffalo Grass, Fleabane, Milkweed, Purple
        Coneflower, Stinging Nettle
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Leathery and waxy leaves to resist water
        loss and help be fire resistant. Grasses go dormant in the winter.
        Bottom growth - plants spend more energy developing a deep root system
        as opposed to growing tall in height. Trees have long taproots to get
        water deep underground.
        <br />
        <strong>Consumers</strong>: Buffalo, Bushbaby, Coyote, Burrowing Owls
        <br />
        <strong>Adaptations</strong>: Some animals have broad, flat-topped
        teeth. Special digestive systems especially adapted to feed on grass.
        Some animals are nocturnal. Some birds burrow since there are so few
        tree. Most animals are brown with stripes and/or spots to camouflage.
